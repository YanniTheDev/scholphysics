# About this Website

This is a website to help New Zealand high school students to prepare for their Scholarship Physics **(Schol Phys)** exams.
Because Schol Phys resources are very de-centralized and very few schools have experienced enough teachers to teach it, we aim
to provide **free open source** resources to any high school student that wish to sit the exam.
